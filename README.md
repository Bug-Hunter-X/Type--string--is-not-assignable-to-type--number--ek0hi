# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript: assigning a string to a number variable.  The error occurs when a variable declared as a number is assigned a string value. TypeScript's type system catches this error during compilation.

The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.ts` demonstrates how to fix this issue by ensuring that string values are not assigned to number variables.
